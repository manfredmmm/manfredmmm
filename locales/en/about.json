  "p1": "Born in Manresa, Barcelona, in 1986. Since I was young, computers and technology have fascinated me. This early passion brought me, in 2004, to start a degree in Computer Science. On the last year of my academic stage, I combined the studies with my first laboral experience at a consultant company. After finishing them, I started working as a freelance for about 5 years. First at imesmes.com and, then, at adverway.com but none of them succeded. Since then, I have been working for other companies.",
  "p2": "I've always worked on web projects, but I found my main motivations in the front end technologies. As a developer, I love searching innovative ways on web applications, looking for a friendly and direct interaction between application and user."
